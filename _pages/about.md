Hey! Iâ€™m Harvey-Jay, an engineer who loves building, automating, and experimenting with tech. Robotics, Medical-Robotics, Automation and Networking are some of my interests and I enjoy finding creative ways to apply engineering to real-world problems and everyday life.

Right now, Iâ€™m a MEng Mechatronics and Robotics student at The University of Hull, diving deep into medical robotics, mechatronics, and hardware/software building alongisde 3D printing. When Iâ€™m not studying, Iâ€™m working on side projects that further my understanding of engineering, spending time with my partner or playing video games.
