Hey! Iâ€™m Harvey-Jay, an engineer who loves building, automating, and experimenting with tech. Robotics, Medical-Robotics, Automation and Networking are some of my interests and I enjoy finding creative ways to apply engineering to real-world problems and everyday life.

Right now, Iâ€™m a MEng Mechatronics and Robotics student at The University of Hull, diving deep into medical robotics, mechatronics, and hardware/software building. When Iâ€™m not studying, Iâ€™m working on side projects that further my understanding of engineering.

What Iâ€™m Working On:

    Writing efficient, scalable code for [something specific youâ€™re working on]
    Exploring AI and financeâ€”automating analysis, testing trading strategies
    Experimenting with AI-generated art (GANs, creative coding)
    Tinkering with hardwareâ€”modding handheld devices, building automation tools

Interests:

ðŸ”§ Robotics, Automation, Cybersecurity, Networking, AI, Open-Source Development and Linux Systems
Current Projects:

ðŸ“± Short-term: Repairing/Hacking handheld devices
ðŸ’» Mid-term: Developing an AI-powered cooking/recipe database
ðŸ•¹ Long-term: Building a handheld emulation device

Always looking for interesting projects and people to work withâ€”letâ€™s build something cool together! ðŸš€
