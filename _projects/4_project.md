This project presents a novel stroke rehabilitation device designed to aid in hand recovery during the acute stages of recovery (early stages). Utilizing 3D printing technology and Arduino-controlled servo motors, the device offers a customizable, cost-effective, and accessible solution for mild to medium stroke survivors.

Bellow is the device without out the mount and circuitry attached for a better visual. The device has 2 states and two algoritms. Algo 1 will stretch each finger individually and then clench. Algo 2 will stretch all the fingers at once and then clench. These algorithms do each 5 times to save for time during demonstration as these algorithms will normally occur for about 10-15mins depending on the paitent. So a total of a 20 to 30min sessions. Additionally I've displayed the flow diagram.

Key features include:

    Personalized 3D-printed components for adjustable fit
    Predefined rehabilitation algorithms to target different muscle groups
    Affordable and adaptable design, integrating off-the-shelf electronics
    Iterative prototyping and testing, ensuring user comfort and effectiveness

This device aims to empower caregivers and patients with home-based rehabilitation options, complementing traditional therapy methods. While challenges such as full fist clenching remain, the project is another tool to the arsenal of assistive stroke recovery technology.
