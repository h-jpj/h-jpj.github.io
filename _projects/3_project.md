This project involves the design and development of a stroke rehabilitation device aimed at aiding hand recovery during the early stages of stroke rehabilitation. The device leverages 3D printing and Arduino-controlled servo motors to offer a cost-effective, customizable, and accessible solution for mild to medium stroke survivors.

The goal is to develop a practical solution that utalizes neuroplasticity in stroke patients by mimicking hand movements needed for recovery to induce dendritic growth. This device can be used by patients at home to complement traditional rehabilitation methods.

Bellow is the device without out the mount and circuitry attached for a better visual. The device has 2 states and two algoritms. Algo 1 will stretch each finger individually and then clench. Algo 2 will stretch all the fingers at once and then clench. These algorithms do each 5 times to save for time during demonstration as these algorithms will normally occur for about 10-15mins depending on the paitent. So a total of a 20 to 30min sessions. Additionally I've displayed the flow diagram.

Key features include:

    Personalized 3D-printed components for adjustable fit
    Predefined rehabilitation algorithms to target different muscle groups
    Affordable and adaptable design, integrating off-the-shelf electronics
    Iterative prototyping and testing, ensuring user comfort and effectiveness

This device aims to empower caregivers and patients with home-based rehabilitation options, complementing traditional therapy methods. The stroke rehabilitation device provides a low-cost, customizable solution for stroke patients to continue rehabilitation at home. Although challenges like achieving a full hand strech remain, the device complements traditional therapy methods and enhances the patientâ€™s recovery process in theory. This project shows the potential of neuroplasticity-driven rehabilitation technologies to support stroke survivors in their journey to regain hand function at home, additionally hoping to relief pressure off of the UK's NHS.
